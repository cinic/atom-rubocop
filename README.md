# rubocop-config

##### BBC News specific config for [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop).

> **RuboCop** is a Ruby static code analyzer. Out of the box it will enforce many of the guidelines outlined in the community [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide).

## Installation

#### Simple (not-recommended)

> Note: if you use this method then you fill have to manually re-download the file.

Add `.rubocop.yml` to the root of your project.

#### Global

1. Clone repo.
2. Symlink `.rubocop.yml` to HOME directory:

```
ln -s path/to/repo/rubocop-config/.rubocop.yml ~/.rubocop.yml
```

## Usage


*Single File*:
```
rubocop <file_name>
```

*All Files in Project*:
```
rubocop
```

*Attempt to auto-correct offenses (take care!)*
```
rubocop -a
```

*Display Offense Names*:
```
rubocop -D
```

Find out more information about an offense name (e.g. `Style/ClassAndModuleChildren`) by searching for it within [default.yml](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop/blob/master/config/default.yml).

### Docker

A docker container is available for running rubocop with the latest version of the config from:

`$: docker pull bbcnews/rubocop-config`

To run it on a project, use the following command:

`$: docker run -v /path/to/your/code:/app bbcnews/rubocop-config`

> You must mount your code as a volume under `/app`.

#### Additional options

As the entry point to the container is `rubocop` you can pass any of the options along as arguments 
when running the container. For example to auto correct all files:

`$: docker run -v /path/to/your/code:/app bbcnews/rubocop-config -a`

#### Git Hook

You can setup your git repos to utilise the `pre-commit` git hook like so:

https://github.com/Integralist/Shell-Scripts/blob/master/hooks/pre-commit-rubocop

#### Shell Alias

The following bash shell function demonstrates how you can test any Ruby code quickly with the `rubo` alias command:

```bash
function rubo() {
  docker run \
    --cpu-shares 1024 \
    --rm=true \
    --volume $(pwd):/app \
    bbcnews/rubocop-config --format simple --fail-level F | grep '^F:\|=='
}
```

> Note: the function has been configured to filter out all feedback except for FATAL errors

## Output

The command shown above will highlight any *offenses* detected within the given file. Any marked with:

- **`F`** (fatal): **must** be fixed.
- **`W`** (warning): more of an subjective offense, need a good reason to ignore.
- **`C`** (convention): more of an subjective offense, need a good reason to ignore.

```
